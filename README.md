# E-commerce store using Vue.js

**Introduction**

This is an E-commerce Store project designed as a web application to allow users to browse, search, filter, and sort products from a mock e-commerce API. The project includes features such as category filtering, sorting by price, and a navigation page for product details.

**Technologies Used**

- **Vue.js**: A progressive JavaScript framework used for building user interfaces. It is designed to be incrementally adoptable and focuses on the view layer. Vue.js enables developers to create reactive and component-based web applications with ease.
- **Styles.css**: defines the styling and layout of web pages, making them more visually appealing, user-friendly, and accessible.
- **Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to retrieve product data from an external API.
- **Vue Router**: The official router for Vue.js, used for building single-page applications with navigation between different views or pages.
- **Pinia**: A state management library for Vue.js, serving as the successor to Vuex. It is designed to be simpler and more lightweight, allowing for easier management of application state.
- **HTML5**: The latest standard of HTML used for structuring web content and providing a semantic structure to the application.
- **Git**: A version control system used to track changes in the source code during development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate and maintain a history of code changes.
- **GitHub**: A web-based platform for version control and collaboration, hosting the source code repository and facilitating project management and issue tracking.
